# Relative Pitch Practicing Project - Google CSSI Capstone

This project was inspired by the need to help students practice for aural music exams such as the ABRSM Aural Theory Tests. It provides users with a way to practice their note identification skills without the assistance of another person or a pre-recorded (and memorizable) CD by randomly generating a note played from a user-selected octave.

This project uses the p5.js sound library and presents user with an interactive way to practice their note identification skills which is useful for relative pitch recognition.

For best effect, run this project with the page expanded to full screen. To run this project simply follow the instructions on the screen, or click the intro page, select an octave by pressing on the octave label (which will play C from that octave) and press the play sound button on the bottom right of the screen. A keyboard will the pop up which allows users to input their guess by playing the matching note on the keyboard.
