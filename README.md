# Pitch Practicing Project - Google CSSI Capstone

This project was heavily inspired by the ABRSM Aural Theory Tests and provides users with a way to practice their note identification skills without the assistance of another person or a pre-recorded (and memorizable CD)

This project uses the p5 sound library and presents user with an interactive game play to practice their note identification skills which is useful for music memory

For best effect, run this project with the page expanded to full screen. To run this project simply follow the instructions on the screen, or click the intro page, select an octave by pressing on the octave label (which will play C from that octave) and press the play sound button on the bottom right quadrant of the screen. A keyboard will the pop up which allows users to input their guess by playing the matching note on the keyboard
